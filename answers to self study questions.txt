Self-Study Questions

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is the foundation of any web application. It’s the skeletal structure. Specifically, it’s organized code with a shared upon standard, structure and meaning. If none of this existed HTML code would have no universal meaning. Thank you W3C for creating an international standard, best practices for markup. 
2. Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
    1. Display:block likes it own space. When invoked it takes up the entire width of the page and disrupts the flow of content.
    2. Display:inline takes up as much space as the content and can bee nested inside of other elements. 
3. What are the 4 areas of the box model? (Starting from inside the element going out)
    1. Content: what’s inside the box such as text/images
    2. Padding: transparent area around the content
    3. Border: goes around the padding and content — can be stylized.
    4. Margin: transparent area outside the border spearing the box from page whitespace. 
4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

- New code can easily be committed;

- Version branches can easily be compared and merged. This is important because each branch functions in an isolated environment, ensuring high quality production in the master branch.

- Allows for easier and faster edits of code.

- Distributed development

- Pull requests (to merge branches, discuss work)
